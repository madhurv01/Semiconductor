By providing substantial financial incentives and policy support, the ISM aims to establish large-scale semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs), display fabs, and other parts of the supply chain, including packaging, assembly, and testing units. This strategic initiative is poised to reduce India's dependence on imports, bolster national security, and create millions of high-value jobs.
